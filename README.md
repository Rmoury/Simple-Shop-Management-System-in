# Simple-Shop-Management-System-in
This Java-based Shop Management System offers a straightforward solution for product
management within shops. The project is comprised of two primary classes: Product and
ShopController. The Product class represents individual products with attributes like product
ID, name, price, quantity, and availability. The ShopController class manages the core logic
for various product operations, including adding, removing, updating, and fetching product
details from a PostgreSQL database using JDBC. The system provides a basic console-based
user interface for seamless interaction, allowing users to perform essential tasks within the
shop. This project serves as an introductory example for Java programming enthusiasts,
demonstrating fundamental concepts of data management and system operations.
